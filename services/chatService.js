            text: `Ah, the Grenadier. In *Company of Heroes 2*, these are the standard infantry units for the German Wehrmacht, a versatile and tough backbone for their forces.
    
    They are adaptable, Comrades. Their primary strength lies in their flexibility. They can be upgraded with an MG42 light machine gun, which significantly boosts their effectiveness against enemy infantry formations. Furthermore, they possess the ability to launch rifle grenades, a useful tool for dislodging entrenched enemies from buildings or dealing with clustered groups of soldiers.
    
    Do not underestimate their anti-tank capabilities, especially in the early stages of a conflict. Grenadiers can be equipped with Panzerfausts. While not a guaranteed tank killer against heavier armor, this light rocket is potent against light vehicles and can critically damage tank engines, slowing them down for other anti-tank assets to exploit. It is important to note that these special abilities consume munitions, so a commander must secure a steady supply of this resource to fully utilize the Grenadiers' potential.
    
    Another notable aspect of the Grenadier is their unique ability to construct bunkers. These defensive structures cost a significant amount of manpower, comparable to a new infantry squad, but offer substantial tactical advantages. Bunkers can be upgraded to serve various purposes: as a medic station to heal nearby troops, a command post to reinforce depleted squads, or a machine gun nest for enhanced defensive firepower. Even without upgrades, a basic bunker provides a sturdy firing position for your troops.
    
    So, you see, the Grenadier is not a simple conscript. They are a multi-purpose unit, capable of engaging infantry, light vehicles, and even constructing forward defensive positions. A wise commander understands their strengths and utilizes them effectively on the battlefield.
    
    Do you have further questions about this unit, or perhaps another aspect of this "game"?`,
